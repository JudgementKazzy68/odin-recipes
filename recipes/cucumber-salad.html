    <h2>A quick, savory and refreshing side</h2>
        <p>Since my childhood, one of my favourite side dish was my mom's cucumber salad with sour cream.</p>
        <p>It is salty, garlicky, creamy and it goes amazingly well with her <a href="./chicken-paprikas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chicken paprikas.</a></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cucumber</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>300 ml of sour cream</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>sugar (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Preparation - 30 minutes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the cucumber into thin slices. (for best result, use a mandoline slicer)</li>
            <li>Salt the slices and set aside in a bowl for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix the sour cream with the crushed garlic and also set aside.
                <p>At this point you can also add 1 teaspoon of sugar to the mix. Some people like this salad slightly sweet, I don't really.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Once the cucumber has let out its juices due to the salt, put them in a colander and gently squeeze out as much juice as possible.</li>
            <li>Mix the garlicky sour cream with the cucumbers.</li>
            <li>You can already eat it, but for the best flavour put it in the fridge for an hour.</li>
            <li>In Hungary, traditionally we sprinkle it with a little bit of paprika powder, but this is up to you.</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Enjoy!</strong>
